# dog_breeds

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Deliveristo Flutter Frontend Coding Challenge
INTRO
We have found your profile very interesting and, in order to understand if you’re a good fit for us, we would like you to show us what you do best: creating an app! Please, make sure you read the requirements very carefully, and start coding! Also, don’t forget to read the "assignment evaluation criteria" paragraph, that explains what we will focus on to grade your work. If you have any questions don’t be afraid to contact us.

ASSIGNMENT
Your task is to create a dashboard that can be used internally to show images of dogs selected by:

Random image by breed
Images list by breed
Random image by breed and sub breed
Images list by breed and sub breed

Feel free to customize and design the page the way you want

BACK END
You need to interact with this public API to get all the data https://dog.ceo/dog-api. This wesbite exposes multiple endpoints.

FRONT END
Please for the frontend use Flutter. Feel free to use any modern tool and architectural style.

IMPORTANT:
No Boilerplate (you can use flutter base one ofc)
Do not overuse external libraries
Use latest Dart syntax
EVALUATION
We expect you to customize the exercise and write code on your own in order to show us your real skills and code cleanliness. We are not evaluating the perfectness of every piece but we expect a well written, quality product with simple, idiomatic code. End to end tests are required. Cover at least a typical user flow run using e2e tests (I click on a button, the image of that dog of that breed appears). Bonus if you add unit tests also. You have to provide us something working and self contained, but at the same time we’d like you to think about:

Test
Architecture
Code quality
Maintainability
Documentation
UX/UI
SUBMISSION
Your solution should be sent as a .git repository where you have saved all your work.
Please insert as well a readme file where you explain briefly how to run everything. We are expecting to run your solution and test it live.
Have fun coding!
